# README - Meeting Agenda Generation

> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-05 by Keming He

Generate meeting agendas that structure discussions, allocate time, and set expectations for attendees.

## Quick Start

Use this skill when you need to:

- Plan a new meeting with clear objectives
- Structure recurring meetings (standups, syncs, reviews)
- Document preparation requirements for attendees

Tell your AI agent: "Create a meeting agenda" or "Plan a meeting for [topic]".

## Agenda Structure

| Section | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preparation | Materials and tasks before meeting |
| Agenda Items | Topics with time allocation and leads |
| Expected Outcomes | Decisions and deliverables |
